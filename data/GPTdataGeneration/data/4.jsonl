The workshop lasts 3 hours, so make sure everything is wrapped up and returned by the end.\nIn a workshop with 5 tables, people can fetch objects to their table and return objects when they are done. You need to imagine what people might be doing and generate a sequence of timestamps and movements for the game. Timestamps are in the format [HH:MM] from the beginning of the workshop, and each new timestamp must be at least 10 minutes after the previous timestamp, unless the objects need to move together and are moved to the same table, such as getting paint and paintbrush together.\n\nThe following objects are available:\n\nBase Objects:\n  - coasters: wooden coaster that can be painted or etched on\n  - keychain: a keychain that can be painted or etched on and decorated with flowers, gems, etc.\n  - mossframe: a wooden frame that can be etched on and filled with moss and flowers, using foamballs for height\n  - photoframe: a frame that can be painted or etched on and decorated with flowers, gems, etc.\n  - plantpot: a pot that can be painted and decorated with moss\n  - suncatcher: a suncatcher that can be painted and decorated with gems\n\nCore Crafting (Painting):\n  - cup: a cup to wash paintbrush in between uses\n  - paint: a set of paints to paint the object\n  - paintbrush: a paintbrush to paint the object\n  - palette: a palette to use for mixing colors\n  - tissuebox: a tissuebox to clean the paintbrush in between uses\n\nCore Crafting (Etching):\n  - etchpen: a burner pen that can be used to etch on the object\n\nCore Crafting (Moss):\n  - moss: a moss that can be used to fill the frame\n  \nFinishing Decorations:\n  - flower: artificial flowers that can be used to decorate the object\n  - foamball: a foamball that can be used to lift items such as flowers and moss\n  - gemset: a set of rhinestone gems that can be used to decorate the object\n  - glue: a glue that can be used to attach the flowers and gems to the object\n  - googlyeyes: googly eyes that can be used to decorate the object\n  - stones: stones that can be used to decorate the object\n  - varnish: a varnish that can be used to finish wooden objects\n\nThe following tables are available:\n- tableA\n- tableB\n- tableC\n- tableD\n- tableE\n\nHere is an example of a sequence of movements:\nStoryline: \n- Alice will use tableC from 00:40 to 02:30.

You need to imagine what people might be doing and generate a sequence of timestamps and movements for the game. Timestamps are in the format [HH:MM] from the beginning of the workshop, and each new timestamp must be at least 10 minutes after the previous timestamp, unless the objects need to move together and are moved to the same table, such as getting paint and paintbrush together.\n\nThe following objects are available:\n\nBase Objects:\n  - coasters: wooden coaster that can be painted or etched on\n  - keychain: a keychain that can be painted or etched on and decorated with flowers, gems, etc.\n  - mossframe: a wooden frame that can be etched on and filled with moss and flowers, using foamballs for height\n  - photoframe: a frame that can be painted or etched on and decorated with flowers, gems, etc.\n  - plantpot: a pot that can be painted and decorated with moss\n  - suncatcher: a suncatcher that can be painted and decorated with gems\n\nCore Crafting (Painting):\n  - cup: a cup to wash paintbrush in between uses\n  - paint: a set of paints to paint the object\n  - paintbrush: a paintbrush to paint the object\n  - palette: a palette to use for mixing colors\n  - tissuebox: a tissuebox to clean the paintbrush in between uses\n\nCore Crafting (Etching):\n  - etchpen: a burner pen that can be used to etch on the object\n\nCore Crafting (Moss):\n  - moss: a moss that can be used to fill the frame\n  \nFinishing Decorations:\n  - flower: artificial flowers that can be used to decorate the object\n  - foamball: a foamball that can be used to lift items such as flowers and moss\n  - gemset: a set of rhinestone gems that can be used to decorate the object\n  - glue: a glue that can be used to attach the flowers and gems to the object\n  - googlyeyes: googly eyes that can be used to decorate the object\n  - stones: stones that can be used to decorate the object\n  - varnish: a varnish that can be used to finish wooden objects\n\nThe following tables are available:\n- tableA\n- tableB\n- tableC\n- tableD\n- tableE\n\nHere is an example of a sequence of movements:\nStoryline: \n- Alice will use tableC from 00:40 to 02:30.

The workshop lasts 3 hours, so make sure everything is wrapped up and returned by the end.\nIn a workshop with 5 tables, people can fetch objects to their table and return objects when they are done. You need to imagine what people might be doing and generate a sequence of timestamps and movements for the game. Timestamps are in the format [HH:MM] from the beginning of the workshop, and each new timestamp must be at least 10 minutes after the previous timestamp, unless the objects need to move together and are moved to the same table, such as getting paint and paintbrush together.\n\nThe following objects are available:\n\nBase Objects:\n  - coasters: wooden coaster that can be painted or etched on\n  - keychain: a keychain that can be painted or etched on and decorated with flowers, gems, etc.\n  - mossframe: a wooden frame that can be etched on and filled with moss and flowers, using foamballs for height\n  - photoframe: a frame that can be painted or etched on and decorated with flowers, gems, etc.\n  - plantpot: a pot that can be painted and decorated with moss\n  - suncatcher: a suncatcher that can be painted and decorated with gems\n\nCore Crafting (Painting):\n  - cup: a cup to wash paintbrush in between uses\n  - paint: a set of paints to paint the object\n  - paintbrush: a paintbrush to paint the object\n  - palette: a palette to use for mixing colors\n  - tissuebox: a tissuebox to clean the paintbrush in between uses\n\nCore Crafting (Etching):\n  - etchpen: a burner pen that can be used to etch on the object\n\nCore Crafting (Moss):\n  - moss: a moss that can be used to fill the frame\n  \nFinishing Decorations:\n  - flower: artificial flowers that can be used to decorate the object\n  - foamball: a foamball that can be used to lift items such as flowers and moss\n  - gemset: a set of rhinestone gems that can be used to decorate the object\n  - glue: a glue that can be used to attach the flowers and gems to the object\n  - googlyeyes: googly eyes that can be used to decorate the object\n  - stones: stones that can be used to decorate the object\n  - varnish: a varnish that can be used to finish wooden objects\n\nThe following tables are available:\n- tableA\n- tableB\n- tableC\n- tableD\n- tableE\n\nHere is an example of a sequence of movements:\nStoryline: \n- Alice will use tableC from 00:40 to 02:30.
